/**
 * Base class for every entity that belongs to a single banking institution / legal
 * entity (tenant) in a multi-entity core banking deployment (e.g. a banking group
 * that operates several licensed entities or a shared platform serving several
 * banks).
 * <p>
 * {@code institutionId} is stamped by Hibernate's discriminator-based multi-tenancy
 * from the current {@code CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver} on insert, and every
 * query against a subclass is transparently filtered to that tenant - this is what
 * gives each institution complete data isolation from the others while sharing the
 * same physical schema.
 * <p>
 * Pure reference/master data that is intentionally shared across every institution
 * (e.g. {@code CountryEntity}, {@code CityEntity}) should extend {@link BaseEntity}
 * directly instead, bypassing tenant filtering.
